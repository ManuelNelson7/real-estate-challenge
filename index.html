                        estate marketing company</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your
                        property
                        to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to
                        identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach
                        them
                        via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent
                        who
                        has partnered with <span class="text-blue">Luxury Presence</span>, you benefit from the many
                        different types of marketing
                        capabilities the company offers.

                    <h4>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h4>
                    <p>To reach your potential buyers, <span class="text-dark">you have to know who they are</span>,
                        where they spend their time
                        online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                        services are able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google,
                        Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are
                        highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are
                        not in the market for a property such as yours.</p>

                <div class="text-container">


                    <h4>Expert Content Production</h4>
                    <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property.
                        Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool
                        that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors.
                        According to a recent survey, <span class="text-dark">85 percent of buyers and sellers want to
                            work with an agent who
                            uses video</span>—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with
                        potential buyers
                        on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they
                        are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something
                        that is much more difficult to do with a written description.
                    </p>
                    <p class="secondary-p">However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property
                        needs to be
                        described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
                        created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real
                        estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your
                        property attractive to potential buyers.</p>

                <div class="text-container">


                    <h4>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h4>
                    <p>Recent research has shown that <span class="text-dark">44% of buyers found the home they
                            purchased</span> on the internet. Many
                        of them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search
                        that way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to
                        use the right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as
                        search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right
                        terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a
                        potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results
                        and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <h4>Social Media Marketing</h4>

                    <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of
                        niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to
                        dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real
                        estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your
                        agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media
                        presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed
                        posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed
                        the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell
                        it more quickly than their competitors.
